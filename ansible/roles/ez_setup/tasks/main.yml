# ez_setup role - DEPRECATED for Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+
#
# This role is no longer needed because:
#   - ez_setup.py was a Python 2 bootstrap mechanism
#   - Python 3 includes pip by default (python3-pip package)
#   - easy_install is deprecated and removed
#
# This role now does nothing but print a deprecation notice.
# It is kept for backward compatibility with existing playbooks.
#
# Migration:
#   - Use 'apt install python3-pip' instead
#   - Use 'pip3 install <package>' for Python packages
#   - Use virtual environments: 'python3 -m venv /path/to/venv'
